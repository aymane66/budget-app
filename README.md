# Budget app
This budget management system allows users to create and manage different spending categories, make deposits and withdrawals, and visualize spending patterns through a spending chart.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aymane66/budget-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd budget-app
    ```

3. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `main.py` script to see an example of using the budget module.

2. Modify the script or create your own instances of the `Category` class to manage different spending categories.

3. Run the script to see the string representation of each category and the spending chart.


## What I Learned

Through working on this budget management system app, I gained valuable experience and insights into several aspects of programming and software development:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Class Design:** I learned how to design and implement classes, such as the `Category` class, to model real-world entities.

- **Instance Methods:** Understanding how to define and use instance methods allowed me to create a clean and modular code structure.

### Python Development

- **List Comprehensions:** Leveraging list comprehensions improved the readability and conciseness of my code, especially when calculating total expenses and percentages.

- **String Formatting:** Utilizing different string formatting techniques, such as f-strings, helped enhance the presentation of output in the string representation of categories.


This project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge and enhance practical skills, ultimately contributing to my growth as a developer.
